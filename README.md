•	Event Management System where students can log in to book slots for upcoming events and these events for students are added by the admin of different universities.

•	Implemented functionalities to get accurate location of all events taking place using Google maps with custom markers and used android navigation components to execute fragment-based development and increased the performance, Firebase Firestore performs as a major backend service and provides some unique functionality whereas, firebase real-time database is used to store user data.

•	 Also whenever a user registers for an event, or on any purchase data is saved in MySQL database (000webhost), developed some micro animation, and used frontend library to improve the user interface.

•	This influenced us to go 100% paperless and users get contest updates on time by getting reminders by firebase notification and scheduling events remotely. Integrated Authentication with Google for login and Sign-up.
